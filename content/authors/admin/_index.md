I am pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at Yale University with a concentration in Programming Languages and Verification, under the guidance of Ruzica Piskac. My recent research focuses on the dynamic inference of real or integer-valued relational properties, including nonlinear equalities and inequalities, random self-reducible properties, functional equations, and recurrence relations by integrating ML with formal techniques. Additionally, I am exploring the application of these properties to enhance areas such as property-based testing, formal verification, side-channel security, self-correcting programs, function synthesis, and privacy-preserving machine learning.

Currently, I am an Applied Scientist Intern with the Automated Reasoning Group at Amazon Web Services (AWS). My work aims to improve the reliability of AWS services by creating advanced tools for model-based testing, conformance checking, randomized testing of distributed networked systems, database systems, and cloud services. 

In the past, I worked on verifying the security of low-level Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) code, including C, C++, and binary analysis. I specialized in detecting side-channel vulnerabilities in cryptographic code using formal techniques. For my master's project at Yale, I developed a probabilistic symbolic execution engine to estimate the power consumption and timing of energy-harvesting, battery-free embedded devices. 

Before PhD school, I worked as a Software Research Engineer on R&D projects within consortia in the aviation and automotive sectors. In these roles, I applied formal methods to both software and system designs.
