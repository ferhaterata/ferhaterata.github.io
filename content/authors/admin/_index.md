I am pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at Yale University with a concentration in Programming Languages and Verification, under the guidance of Ruzica Piskac. My recent research focuses on the dynamic inference of real or integer-valued relational properties, including nonlinear equalities and inequalities, random self-reducible properties, functional equations, and recurrence relations by integrating ML with formal techniques. Additionally, I am exploring the application of these properties to enhance areas such as property-based testing, formal verification, side-channel security, self-correcting programs, function synthesis, and privacy-preserving machine learning.
