I am pursuing a PhD in [Computer Science](https://cpsc.yale.edu) at Yale University under the guidance of [Ruzica Piskac](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/piskac/) and [Jakub Szefer](https://caslab.csl.yale.edu/~jakub/). My current research focuses on the automated inference of program properties and invariants by integrating _machine learning_ with _formal methods_. 
<!-- Additionally, I am conducting research on discrete program search to automatically solve abstraction and reasoning tasks. -->

I am also an Applied Scientist Intern at the [Automated Reasoning Group](https://www.amazon.science/research-areas/automated-reasoning) of Amazon Web Services (AWS), working on neurosymbolic program synthesis to capture symbolic knowledge and detect hallucinations of LLMs in logical reasoning.
<!-- mentored by [Rupak Majumdar](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rupak/). I am developing tools for model-based testing, conformance checking, and fuzzing of distributed networked systems. -->
<!-- My work aims to improve the reliability of AWS services by creating advanced tools for model-based testing, conformance checking, and randomized testing of distributed networked systems.  -->
<!-- and [Nafi Diallo](https://linkedin.com/in/ndiallo).  -->

I have worked on verifying the side-channel insecurity of low-level Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) code ([EuroS&P 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10190541)). I explored reverse engineering quantum circuits from power side-channel traces ([CHES 2024](https://ferhat.ai/publication/erata-2024-quantum/erata-2024-quantum.pdf), [CCS 2023](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3576915.3623118)), quantum fault injections ([QCE 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05478)), and detection quantum computer viruses ([HOST 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10133711)). Additionally, I explored automated analysis of non-functional behaviors of intermittent programs ([TECS 2023](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3563216)), and surveyed security verification techniques ([JETC 2023](https://doi.org/10.1145/3564785)).
