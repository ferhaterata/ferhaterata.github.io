I am pursuing my PhD in [Computer Science](https://cpsc.yale.edu) at Yale University with a concentration in Programming Languages and Verification, under the guidance of [Ruzica Piskac](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/piskac/) and [Jakub Szefer](https://caslab.csl.yale.edu/~jakub/). My recent research focuses on the dynamic inference of real or integer-valued relational properties from implementations by integrating machine learning with formal techniques. Additionally, I am exploring the application of these properties to enhance areas such as property-based testing, formal verification, side-channel security, self-correcting programs, function synthesis, and privacy-preserving machine learning.

I am an Applied Scientist Intern with the [Automated Reasoning Group](https://www.amazon.science/research-areas/automated-reasoning) at Amazon Web Services (AWS) mentored by [Rupak Majumdar](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rupak/). My work aims to improve the reliability of AWS services by creating advanced tools for model-based testing, conformance checking, randomized testing of distributed networked systems and cloud services.
