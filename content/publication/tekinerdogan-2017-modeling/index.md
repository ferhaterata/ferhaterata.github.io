abstract: An important aspect in SoS is the realization of the concerns in different
  systems that work together. Identifying and locating these concerns is important
  to orchestrate the overall activities and hereby to achieve the overall goal of
  the SoS. Moreover, concerns in SoS are rarely stable and need to evolve in different
  ways and different times in accordance with the changing requirements. To manage
  the SoS and cope with the evolution of concerns it is necessary that the dependency
  links between the concerns and the system elements can be easily traced. In this
  paper, we present the different traceability requirements and the corresponding
  metamodel to support modeling traceability and supporting traceability analysis
  approaches within the SoS context.
