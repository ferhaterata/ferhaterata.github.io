abstract: 'Software modeling is considered as the high-level design technique for
  describing abstract statements about software systems. While some practitioners
  create models for the early analysis of their design decisions and generating code
  from their models, some practitioners create models for the eased communication
  among stakeholders. There also exist practitioners who ignore modeling and directly
  proceed with coding. We aim in this paper to understand the challenges that practitioners
  face with in their software modeling activities. We surveyed 80 practitioners from
  18 countries who work in 18 different industries. We focussed on 8 categories of
  software modeling challenges: (i) managing the language complexity, (ii) extending
  modeling languages, (iii) domain-specific modeling environments, (iv) developing
  formal modeling languages, (v) analysing models, (vi) separation of concerns, (vii)
  transforming models, and (viii) managing models. As the results show, the separation
  of concerns is the least challenging category for practitioners, while analysing
  models is the top challenging category. Various concrete challenges in different
  categories have been observed, including (i) using the modeling languages with steep
  learning-curve, (ii) extending the language semantics without inconsistencies and
  updating the language tools accordingly, (iii) evolving the DSL tools with new requirements,
  (iv) defining the languagesâ€™ formal semantics in terms of the translations in any
  formal languages, (v) decomposing models into separate viewpoints and analysing
  the consistencies between different viewpoint models, (vi) the consistent model
  transformation and the model synchronisations, (vii) using model checkers for formal
  analysis, and (viii) versioning models.'
