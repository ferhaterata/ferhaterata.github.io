abstract: Traceability can be defined as the degree to which a relationship can be
  established among work products of the development process. Traceability is important
  to support the consistency and likewise to ensure that a system is understandable,
  maintainable and reliable. Several approaches have been proposed to model traceability
  elements and reason about them by extending a predetermined set of possible trace
  links with fixed semantics. Furthermore, they do not cope with the need for dynamic
  adaptation and configuration of traceability semantics. However, different project
  types usually require various ways of tracing the system to obtain richer and precise
  automated traceability analysis. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach with
  its supporting platform which enables the user to rigorously configure the system
  based on project-specific needs and interactively specify the semantics of traceability
  elements. The semantics of traceability elements are formalized using first-order
  relational logic, which are used to facilitate different form of automated analysis.
  The use of the proposed approach and the corresponding tool is described within
  the context of an industrial application lifecycle management process.
