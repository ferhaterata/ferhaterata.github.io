abstract: An important aspect in system of systems (SoS) is the realization of the
  capabilities in different systems that work together. Identifying and locating these
  capabilities are important to orchestrate the overall activities and hereby to achieve
  the overall goal of the SoS. System elements and capabilities in SoS however, are
  rarely stable and need to evolve in different ways and different times in accordance
  with the changing requirements. To manage the SoS and cope with its evolution it
  is necessary that the dependency links to the capabilities and the system elements
  can be easily traced. Several approaches have been proposed to model traceability
  and reason about these by extending a predetermined set of possible trace links
  with fixed semantics. However, for the context of SoS a fixed traceability model
  with fixed traceability semantics is limited to consider the various different and
  changing scenarios. In this article, we first present the different traceability
  requirements for managing traceability in the context of SoS. Subsequently, we present
  the metamodel and the corresponding domain specific language to support modeling
  traceability and traceability analysis approaches within the evolving SoS context.
  Further, we provide the tool support for automated reasoning of traceability of
  SoS capabilities and system elements. We illustrate and discuss the approach for
  the application to a smart city SoS.
