 abstract = {This chapter presents the ontology for Multi-Paradigm Modelling (MPM) specfied using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) as introduced in Chapter 2. A thorough state of the art on MPM's core notions including multi-formalism and model management approaches, languages and tools is presented. In particular, model management approaches have been characterized according to their modularity and incremental execution properties as required to scale for the large complex CPSs we face today. Based on this state of the art, an outline of the MPM ontology is developed by introducing its main classes and properties. The validation of the ontology is presented by showing how it can adequatly model the two case studies briefly introduced in Chapter 2.},
