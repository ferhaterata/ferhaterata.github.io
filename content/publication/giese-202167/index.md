abstract: This chapter presents the ontology for Multi-Paradigm Modelling (MPM) specfied
  using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) as introduced in Chapter 2. A thorough state
  of the art on MPM's core notions including multi-formalism and model management
  approaches, languages and tools is presented. In particular, model management approaches
  have been characterized according to their modularity and incremental execution
  properties as required to scale for the large complex CPSs we face today. Based
  on this state of the art, an outline of the MPM ontology is developed by introducing
  its main classes and properties. The validation of the ontology is presented by
  showing how it can adequatly model the two case studies briefly introduced in Chapter
  2.
