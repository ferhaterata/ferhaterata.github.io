abstract: This chapter presents the Multi-Paradigm Modelling for Cyber-Physical Systems
  (MPM4CPS) ontology. This ontology integrates the Shared, MPM and CPS ontologies
  respectively introduced in Chapters 2, 3 and 4. It includes cross-cutting notions
  such as viewpoints, model-based development processes and modelling paradigms that
  together relate the formalisms and workflows (and their paradigms) to the part of
  CPSs developed with these formalisms. A brief state of the art on these notions
  is first presented, on which the MPM4CPS ontology builds. An overview of the ontology
  is then developed by introducing its main classes and properties. The validation
  of the ontology is finally presented by showing how it can adequately model the
  two case studies briefly introduced in Chapter 2. The chapter also discusses perspectives
  and future work on this integrated ontological framework, which can serve as a basis
  to develop model management solutions to relate and combine modelling languages
  and tools, in order to better develop cyber-physical systems with appropriate formalismes
  and workflows.
