abstract: 'Context Software architecture viewpoints modularize the software architectures
  in terms of different viewpoints that each address a different concern. Unified
  Modeling Language (UML) is so popular among practitioners for modeling software
  architectures from different viewpoints.  Objective In this paper, we aimed at understanding
  the practitioners’ UML usage for the modeling of software architectures from different
  viewpoints.  Method To this end, 109 practitioners with diverse profiles have been
  surveyed to understand practitioners’ UML usage for six different viewpoints: functional,
  information, concurrency, development, deployment, and operational. Each viewpoint
  has been considered in terms of a set of software models that can be created in
  that viewpoint.  Results The survey includes 35 questions for different viewpoint
  models, and the results lead to interesting findings. While the top popular viewpoints
  for the UML-based software architecture modeling are the functional (96%) and information
  (99%) viewpoints, the least popular one is the operational viewpoint that is considered
  by 26% of the practitioners. The top popular UML modeling tool is Enterprise Architect
  regardless of the viewpoints considered. Concerning the software models that can
  be created in each viewpoint, UML’s class diagram is practitioners’ top choice for
  the functional structure (71%), data structure (85%), concurrency structure (75%),
  software code structure (34%), and system installation (39%), and system support
  (16%) models; UML’s sequence diagram is the top choice for the data lifecycle models
  (47%); UML’s deployment diagram for the physical structure (71%), mapping between
  the functional and physical components (53%), and system migration (21%) models;
  UML’s activity diagram for the data flow (65%), software build and release processes
  (20–22%), and system administration (36%) models; UML’s component diagram for the
  mapping between the functional and concurrent components (35%), software module
  structure (47%), and system configuration (21%) models; and UML’s package diagram
  for the software module structure (47%) models.'
