abstract: We present AlloyInEcore, a tool for specifying metamodels with their static
  semantics to facilitate automated, formal reasoning on models. Software development
  projects require that software systems be specified in various models (e.g., requirements
  models, architecture models, test models, and source code). It is crucial to reason
  about those models to ensure the correct and complete system specifications. AlloyInEcore~allows
  the user to specify metamodels with their static semantics, while, using the semantics,
  it automatically detects inconsistent models, and completes partial models. It has
  been evaluated on three industrial case studies in the automotive domain (https://modelwriter.github.io/AlloyInEcore/).
