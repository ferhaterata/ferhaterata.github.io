abstract: The development of quantum computers has been advancing rapidly in recent
  years. In addition to researchers and companies building bigger and bigger machines,
  these computers are already being actively connected to the internet and offered
  as cloud-based quantum computer services. As quantum computers become more widely
  accessible, potentially malicious users could try to execute their code on the machines
  to leak information from other users, to interfere with or manipulate results of
  other users, or to reverse engineer the underlying quantum computer architecture
  and its intellectual property, for example. To analyze such new security threats
  to cloud-based quantum computers, this work first proposes and explores different
  types of quantum computer viruses. This work shows that quantum viruses can impact
  outcomes of Groverâ€™s search algorithm or machine learning classification algorithms
  running on quantum computers, for example. The work then proposes a first of its
  kind quantum computer antivirus as a new means of protecting the expensive and fragile
  quantum computer hardware from quantum computer viruses. The antivirus can analyze
  quantum computer programs, also called circuits, and detect possibly malicious ones
  before they execute on quantum computer hardware. As a compile-time technique, it
  does not introduce any new overhead at run-time of the quantum computer.
