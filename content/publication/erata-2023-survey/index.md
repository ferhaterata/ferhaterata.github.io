abstract: 'This article surveys the landscape of security verification approaches
  and techniques for computer systems at various levels: from a software-application
  level all the way to the physical hardware level. Different existing projects are
  compared, based on the tools used and security aspects being examined. Since many
  systems require both hardware and software components to work together to provide
  the systemâ€™s promised security protections, it is not sufficient to verify just
  the software levels or just the hardware levels in a mutually exclusive fashion.
  This survey especially highlights system levels that are verified by the different
  existing projects and presents to the readers the state of the art in hardware and
  software system security verification. Few approaches come close to providing full-system
  verification, and there is still much room for&nbsp;improvement.'
