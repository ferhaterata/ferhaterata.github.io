abstract: The rapid growth of interest in quantum computing has brought about the
  need to secure these powerful machines against a range of physical attacks. As qubit
  counts increase and quantum computers achieve higher levels of fidelity, their potential
  to execute novel algorithms and generate sensitive intellectual property becomes
  more promising. However, there is a significant gap in our understanding of the
  vulnerabilities these computers face in terms of security and privacy attacks. Among
  the potential threats are physical attacks, including those orchestrated by malicious
  insiders within data centers where the quantum computers are located, which could
  compromise the integrity of computations and resulting data. This paper presents
  an exploration of fault-injection attacks as one class of physical attacks on quantum
  computers. This work first introduces a classification of fault-injection attacks
  and strategies, including the domain of fault-injection attacks, the fault targets,
  and fault manifestations in quantum computers. The resulting classification highlights
  the potential threats that exist. By shedding light on the vulnerabilities of quantum
  computers to fault-injection attacks, this work contributes to the development of
  robust security measures for this emerging technology.
