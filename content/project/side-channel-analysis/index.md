# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This work shows the first exploration and study of power-based side-channel attacks in quantum computers.  The explored attacks could be used to recover information about the control pulses sent to these computers. By analyzing these control pulses, attackers can reverse-engineer the equivalent gate-level description of the circuits, and the algorithms being run, or data hard-coded into the circuits.
